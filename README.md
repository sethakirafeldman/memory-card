# Pixar Memory Card Game

## Description

This application was created as part of The Odin Project's [Full Stack JavaScript curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-memory-card). 

A live version of this is hosted on [Netlify](https://seth-memory-card.netlify.app/).

## Technology

It uses the [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) toolchain, and much of the boilerplate was removed. The code is written using ES6+ syntax, and the useState and useEffect react hooks.
